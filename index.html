                    French is one of the main languages of the world. It is a main or official language not only in France, but in parts of Belgium and Switzerland, in Monaco, in parts of Canada - notably but not only in Quebec - and widely spoken in North Africa and the West, in Lebanon and parts of Southeast Asia, especially in the former French colonies. It is an official or second main language in 55 countries around the world and is reputed to be the most widely used foreign language in international communication, after English. Nearly 300 million people speak French as a mother tongue or as a second language.
